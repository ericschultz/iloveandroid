###(Not so) Frequently Asked Questions
####Is there a story behind I Love Android?
I bought my Motorola Droid in February 2010 in part because of how open it was. By March I had gotten up the nerve to replace its firmware and saw how amazing the Android ecosystem is. Not too long after this, Apple introduced its notoriously restrictive SDK for the iPhone that dictates the programming language you can use on the iPhone. When I heard of this, I immediately thought about Android's open nature and how "I Love Android." Since I wanted to learn Android programming anyways, I investigated possible applications I could make to show my love of Android and to protest Apple's offensive restrictions.

####Are you getting any money from the Android Market sales?
No. Google takes a 30% fee for Android Market sales but all of the other 70% is donated to FSF's High Priority Projects campaign.

####I don't trust that you're going to donate!
While I wish you would trust me, that's fine. Please donate directly to the FSF's High Priority Projects campaign. Don't let your distrust of me keep you from supporting a great cause!

####What is the Free Software Foundation?
From fsf.org: "The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom and to defend the rights of all free software users."

####What does that mean?
They develop licenses and provide other support for software projects that are considered "free" or "open source" software. "Free/open source" software is software where the user can see and modify the code that its developers created the program with.

####What is the FSF's High Priority Projects campaign?
In certain highly used types of software, there isn't any high quality open source software. The FSF's High Priority Projects campaign raises money for development and provides publicity for software projects intending to fill these gaps. Some of the projects include:

* **Gnash** - a fully functional replacement for the Adobe Flash player
* **GNU PDF** - a set of libraries for managing the PDF files that comply with the latest ISO standard
* __Free Software Replacement for Skype__ - Skype is not open source and more importantly its protocol is undocumented. Skype refuses to answer whether they have a backdoor in the protocol that allows them to eavesdrop on Skype conversations.

A full list of the project are at <http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/>
